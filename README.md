## MacOS settings

I also made a few settings to MacOS  
### make Dock and the native MacOS bar auto-hide  
somewhere in the macOS settings

### disable window animations
`defaults write -g NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool false`

### disable lots of MacOS keyboard shortcuts in the MacOS settings
- disable command+Q in MacOS system settings

### Move windows by dragging any part of the window (by holding ctrl+cmd)
`defaults write -g NSWindowShouldDragOnGesture -bool true`
